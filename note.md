Git: version control for software development
Eg: for games, save feature, checkpoints
    - Software improves over time -> need sth to keep track  of all of the version
    -Adding new things could potentially break the current version

<!-- cmd -->
git init . -> initialize a respository(repo) aka project
git add . or git add (file name) -> add all of the file and folder in the current directory
